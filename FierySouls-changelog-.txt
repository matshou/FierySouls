Version 1.1.4

Changelog:

- The strength of light ignited torches emit in their environment is now parameterized.
  It will slowly start to diminish when the torch is nearing the end of it's life cycle. 

- Implemented defined update intervals for torch tile entities.
  This should improve the performance quality of these entities.
  
- Removed redundant comments and code blocks from BlockTorchLit.

Version 1.1.3

Changelog:

- Implemented torch combustion, they will not extinguish after a defined period of time has passed.
- The torch will now actually burn out becoming a permanent unlit torch unable to be ignited by fire again.
- Did a little bit of code formatting, nothing major.

Version 1.1.2

Changelog:

- Added a new recipe for unlit torches. They can now be crafted with charcoal.
- Any custom resource can now be crafted with more then one recipes.
- All vanilla torch recipes are now correctly removed from the list.
- Added .gitignore rules to the project, the repository can now be hosted inside Forge DE.

Notes:
This version resolves the issue of a charcoal torch recipe not being removed from the CraftingManager recipe list.
It took me quite a while to figure out what was causing this, and in the end it turned out it was just a problem of accessing the wrong index.
This topic on the Forge forum helped me solve this:

Version 1.1.1

Changelog:

- Added a client version limiter.
- Cleaned up redundant imports in Item and TileEntity packages.
- Tile entities are now able to read and write data using NBT.
- Added a missing entry in the changelog.
- Updated the Git license file.

Version 1.1.0

Changelog:

- Did some considerable changes to torch tile entity code.
- Introduced new mechanics for torches, humidity. When directly exposed to rain torches start to collect humidity
  and extinguish if enough humidity is accumulated. After getting considerably wet they are unable to be ignited again with fire sources.

- Fiery Souls creative tab is now displaying the correct name.
- Fixed a formatting mistake in the license part of the readme.

Notes:
The tile entities are still not able to save data, I will implement this in the next update.


Version 1.0.1, Build 105 
 
Changelog: 
 
- Introduced client and server proxies. The mod should be multiplayer friendly now. 
- Implemented custom object handler that takes care of item and block initialization and registration for us. 
- Our custom torches are now both blocks and tile entities. 
 
- Matchbox can no longer light torches on fire when the torch is directly exposed to rain. 
- Torches can be extinguished by activating them with no item equipped in our hands or directly exposing them to rain  
  and ignited with either a matchbox or a lit torch equipped in our hands. 
- Torches can only be extinguished by strong rain and no longer extinguish exactly the moment they are placed on rain. 
- After being extinguished, torches will emit small smoke particles for a short period of time.  
 
- Added recipes for our custom torches and removed vanilla torch recipes. 
- Ignited torches now have a probability (based on block flammability data) to set blocks above them on fire.

Notes: 
This project originally started as a fork of another project founded and actively developed by ChaosTheDude on GitHub. 
The project was aiming at improving the functionality and realism of vanilla torches. Since the author of the mentioned 
project did not want to co-develop the project with me and shares a different vision of open source development I decided 
to expand my own project and migrate to a new repository. 
 
I've copied the last version in the fork and worked on it until it was stable enough to be a good base. 
Since at the moment I am the only one developing this mod and this is a fresh start a good idea would be to establish 
various development conventions: each commit should contain a changelog like this, version number convention should be  
(Major version).(Minor version).(Revision iteration)-(Build number).
