Fiery Souls - Version 1.0.1, Build 105 
 
Changelog: 
 
- Introduced client and server proxies. The mod should be multiplayer friendly now. 
- Implemented custom object handler that takes care of item and block initialization and registration for us. 
- Our custom torches are now both blocks and tile entities. 
 
- Matchbox can no longer light torches on fire when the torch is directly exposed to rain. 
- Torches can be extinguished by activating them with no item equipped in our hands or directly exposing them to rain  
  and ignited with either a matchbox or a lit torch equipped in our hands. 
- Torches can only be extinguished by strong rain and no longer extinguish exactly the moment they are placed on rain. 
- After being extinguished, torches will emit small smoke particles for a short period of time.  
 
- Added recipes for our custom torches and removed vanilla torch recipes. 
- Ignited torches now have a probability (based on block flammability data) to set blocks above them on fire.

Notes: 
This project originally started as a fork of another project founded and actively developed by ChaosTheDude on GitHub. 
The project was aiming at improving the functionality and realism of vanilla torches. Since the author of the mentioned 
project did not want to co-develop the project with me and shares a different vision of open source development I decided 
to expand my own project and migrate to a new repository. 
 
I've copied the last version in the fork and worked on it until it was stable enough to be a good base. 
Since at the moment I am the only one developing this mod and this is a fresh start a good idea would be to establish 
various development conventions: each commit should contain a changelog like this, version number convention should be  
(Major version).(Minor version).(Revision iteration)-(Build number).
